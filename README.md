# go-media-metadata

## Introduction

go-media-metadata is intended to be a tool for reading metadata from media files. Inital goal is to support reading metadata from MOV/MP4 files only, but eventually I may expand it as the need arises. While it is a super handy and powerful tool, I an attempting to work around the need for exterenal dependencies on `mediainfo` just to keep things simple for application distribution.
